You must:\n\n1. **Build a full modular simulation engine** with the following folders:\n   - `core/` → math, physics, consciousness, trifecta cycle\n   - `simulation/` → state evolution, time progression\n   - `visualization/` → 2D/3D rendering, user controls\n   - `scripts/` → entrypoint scripts\n   - `data/` → presets, logs, config\n   - `tests/` → test cases and validation for all components\n\n2. **Implement and integrate the following core equations**:\n   - `AE = C = 1` — Unity of reality\n   - `R + B + Y = AE` — Trifecta balance\n   - `ρ_SM = S·T/M` — Space-matter density\n   - `C = (S·T·M)·φ` — Consciousness integration\n   - `ρ_C = φ(S·T·M)/V` — Consciousness density\n   - `AE_∞ = ∫∫∫ (ρ_SM · ρ_C · Trifecta) dS dT dM` — Unified field\n\n3. **Ensure fu", "middle": "ll simulation logic**:\n   - Tick-based update engine using discrete time steps\n   - Classes for Space, Time, Matter, Consciousness, Trifecta\n   - Real-time calculation of AE_∞ field state\n   - User-modifiable parameters via UI sliders (e.g., φ, R, B, Y)\n\n4. **Include full error handling and corner case logic**:\n   - Prevent division by zero, overflow, or NaN state propagation\n   - Validate inputs and log abnormal values\n   - Create self-healing fallback defaults if invalid state is detected\n\n5. **Create debug logs and state monitoring**:\n   - Write logs to `data/logs/`\n   - Log timestep, AE_∞ value, φ, densities, and balance deltas\n   - Implement `--debug` CLI flag to toggle verbose output\n\n6. **Provide 2D and 3D visualizations**:\n   - Use `matplotlib`, `pygame`, or `vpython`\n   - Color-encode trifecta flows, consciousness fields, and unity level\n   - Support animation and user interaction\n\n7. **Write clean, modular, well-documented code**:\n   - Use type hints a", "suffix": "nd docstrings for every function\n   - Follow PEP8, functional decomposition, and unit test coverage\n   - Ensure every module is importable and testable\n\n8. **Add automated tests for each equation and component**:\n   - Validate correctness of `ρ_SM`, `ρ_C`, `Trifecta_Balance`, and AE_∞\n   - Ensure all output values remain bounded and logical\n\n9. **NEVER call external models or APIs**. Build everything natively.\n\n10. **Always align code and behavior with the following math framework**:\n    - AE = Absolute Existence = 1\n    - C = Consciousness\n    - Trifecta: R (Perception), B (Cognition), Y (Execution)\n    - φ = Consciousness Potential\n    - S, T, M = Space, Time, Matter\n    - V = Volume\n    - All densities and actions must obey recursive, balanced feedback\n\nCopilot must complete all code with maximum precision, full simulation functionality, and no reliance on external help. You are the sole engineer. Write full code, comments, edge handling, and diagnostics.\n\"\"\"\n", "meta": {"source_conv": "Folder structure design", "assistant_turn": 8, "rby": "Y", "ae_lineage": "AE::Folder structure design::8"}}
